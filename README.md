Django Rest API

in this project, I uses AbstractBaseUser, PermissionsMixin, BaseUserManager for building custom User Model

build API for user profile where user can Register, update their own information, see other users profile

user can post anything & only authenticated user can see other users feeds & only can update their own feed.

also implement token based authentication system
